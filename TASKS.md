## Testing Checklist üß™
- [ ] Claude Code executes in container
- [ ] API key encryption/decryption works
- [ ] WebSocket streams output correctly
- [ ] File operations persist across sessions
- [ ] Container snapshots restore properly
- [ ] Usage tracking is accurate
- [ ] Billing calculations are correct

## Deployment Checklist üöÄ
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Cloudflare secrets set (D1, R2, KV)
- [ ] Container registry configured
- [ ] Domain and routing set up
- [ ] SSL certificates active
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards created
- [ ] Error tracking enabled

## Future Enhancements üí°
- [ ] Multi-cursor collaboration (Liveblocks)

## Notes üìù
- Using Cloudflare Containers beta (basic tier: 1 GiB / ¬º vCPU)
- Claude Code SDK requires Node.js 18+ in container
- API keys stored encrypted in D1 using libsodium
- WebSocket connections limited to 1 per user initially
- Container sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity
